===================
Goals Character Sheet was a learning experiment the project itself I limited to 80 hours and scoped the features to match that, although data entry took much longer then the coding itself, I did not add those ours to the equation. The goals for this project was to learn Bootstrap.js, learn Entity Framework, and to develop a controller and model framework that would handle most the CRUD operation without coding views for every entity.  

Main Framework:

src\Web\Scripts\GoalsCore.js

src\Web\Models\ViewModel.cs

src\Web\Controllers\BaseController.cs

src\Web\Views\Shared\Partials

Example Usage:

src\Web\Controllers\GoalsClassesController.cs

src\Web\Models\GoalsClassViewModel.cs
